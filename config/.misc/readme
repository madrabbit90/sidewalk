--getting started--

Welcome to Sidewalk, a simple, pretty media frontend designed
for TVs and handhelds that allows you to flip through your
frequently used games and media and rotate them regularly with ease,
while still being able to access the Linux OS under the hood.

To make changes to your Sidewalk tiles, access the terminal and
file manager tools or view parental restricted content, unlock
your session by pressing the "u" key and entering your PIN
("12345" by default). This will be indicated by the glowing
white cursor turning red. You can lock the session at any time
by pressing "r".

--add tiles--

When saving coverarts for your tiles, add them to the "Pictures"
folder in your home directory with no spaces or file extensions
".jpg et al" in the filename. Now, press the "a" key.

Choose the type of tile you want to create, pick the coverart
from your file list, then give it a snazzy title. (NOTE: adding
".lock" to the end of the title will restrict access to the
media and require a PIN.)

Sidewalk will attempt to create a new tile based on your
selection by looking for specific folders and files with the
same name as the coverart.

Linux apps: /usr/bin/<filename>
Movies: ./Videos/<filename>
DVD dumps and Video playlists: ./Videos/<foldername>
Emulator playlist: ./Games/<foldername>
Photo album: ./Photos/<foldername>

--delete tiles--

Put the cursor on the tile and press the "DELETE" key. Poof. Gone.

--shuffle tiles--

Put the cursor on a tile and press "c" for copy. Put the cursor
on another tile and press "p" for paste. The tiles will swap places.

--change wallpaper--

Press the "w" key. Any amimated GIF files in the ./Pictures directory
with the .gif extension will be selectable.

--hide interface--

Have a pretty wallpaper and want to see the whole thing? Press the
"h" key to hide the UI and any arrow key to call it back.

--music tool--

The music tool in the bottom toolbar can play any audio file
stored in the ./Music directory. You can also close the tool while
audio continues playing in the background. Perfect for yule logs,
birthday parties and replacing in-game audio with your own soundtrack.

--backend info--

Being a frontend, Sidewalk depends on several open source Linux
applications on the "backend" to work properly.

python/pygame - interface
mplayer - runs videos and DVD playback
mednafen - runs retro game roms
feh - views photos
moc - music player tool
alsamixer - volume control tool
wicd-curses - wifi tool
ranger - file manager tool
links2 - fileserver tool

I have no aspirations to support a wider range of media players
or emulator cores. Sidewalk is not meant to compete with the likes
of SteamOS and Retroarch, but rather written to serve the niche
needs of my wife and kids. The software I have chosen integrates
well, is good enough, and "just works".

I offer Sidewalk as open source for anyone to do whatever, but
as for me, outside of bugfixes and security updates, this is
as far as I go.

Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy your Sidewalk experience.
